## History

This variation of [Texas hold'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) originated from an evening on September 6, 2022, where a group of longtime friends, originally from [Gatineau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatineau) and now in [Montreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatineau), wanted to play poker but didn't have any poker chips. They ended up playing a normal game but with fictional bets. However, it didn't offer the same level of excitement, so they stopped.

Later in the evening, the group of friends had chicken wings for dinner with their favorite hot sauces. Without any particular reason, they started challenging each other to add hotter sauces to their wings to demonstrate their resistance to the other members of the group. It was at that moment that the idea of combining poker and hot sauce was born.

Over subsequent evenings, the group of friends refined the rules of this new game they had invented: Hell's Poker. The management of blinds was introduced, as well as the variant called [The Final Countdown](#the-final-countdown).

## Basic Rules

Hell's Poker is played like [Texas hold'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em). The only difference lies in the nature of the bets.

Hot sauces are placed in the middle of the table (leaving room for the cards). A minimum of 10 sauces is recommended to provide a progression in the bets.

During each betting round, players can choose to raise, call, fold, or check.

### Player Options during a Betting Round

- Raise: Betting a higher-value hot sauce than the current bet.
- Call: Staying in the round by matching the current bet.
- Fold: Abandoning the round. The player must consume hot sauce equivalent to their bet and can participate in the next round. Refer to [Consumption of the hot sauce](#consumption-of-the-hot-sauce).
- Check: Staying in the round at the current bet if no one has raised in the current round.

Blinds:

- The mildest sauce serves as the small blind.
- The second mildest sauce serves as the big blind.

### Consumption of the hot sauce

Each player who folds or loses at the [showdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showdown_(poker)) must consume the hot sauce equivalent to their bet or none if they didn't have a blind. The hot sauce can be consumed as is or on a medium such as a chicken wing or a chip.

## Variants

### The Final Countdown

After each round, the mildest hot sauce is removed from the game.
